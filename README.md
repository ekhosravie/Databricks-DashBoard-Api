Hello everyone! Welcome to today's video. If you're into data analysis, machine learning, and interactive dashboards, you’ll love what we’re diving into today. 
Databricks has just rolled out some exciting new features with the Fall 2024 release of their AI & BI Dashboards—and let me tell you,
these features are a game-changer! With the latest update, users can build highly dynamic, visually engaging dashboards that integrate AI capabilities to make data insights come alive.

You can read all about the features on Databricks’ official blog here. They’ve introduced some fantastic tools for building dashboards that allow users to easily visualize data and create intuitive, interactive reports.

I was inspired by this blog post and decided to create a similar dashboard for you all today. But here’s the twist—I’m using Databricks Community Edition.
While some of the new premium features are only available in the paid version, I’m going to show you how we can still build something just as powerful, using the tools available to Community Edition users.

In this video, we’ll focus on building a dynamic restaurant map that will show locations based on user input,
plus a bar chart for category distribution and even a Sunburst chart for more detailed insights.
We’ll work through the code step-by-step and I’ll explain the concepts both technically and conceptually as we go along.
Let's get started and see how far we can take Databricks, even in the Community Edition!
